# Comparative Analysis of Scheduling Algorithms

## ML-Driven Educational Institution Scheduling System

A comprehensive machine learning-driven scheduling system for educational institutions that compares three distinct algorithmic approaches: Machine Learning Generated, Greedy Baseline, and Iterative Improvement algorithms.

## Project Overview

This project implements a sophisticated multi-stage pipeline for educational scheduling that processes 156 classes across grades 1-9, involving 500 teachers and 15 subjects, generating high-quality assignments with comprehensive constraint satisfaction analysis.

## Key Results

- **ML Generated Algorithm**: 82.3% feasibility, 6,330 assignments, 1,628 constraint violations
- **Iterative Improvement Algorithm**: 75.0% feasibility, 6,654 assignments, 1,900+ constraint violations  
- **Greedy Baseline Algorithm**: 70.0% feasibility, 6,654 assignments, 2,100+ constraint violations

## System Architecture

The system implements a multi-stage pipeline:

```
Data Generation → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Schedule Generation → Validation
```

### Core Components

1. **Data Generation Module**: Creates synthetic datasets for classes, teachers, rooms, curriculum, and teacher availability
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracts relevant features including teacher-class compatibility, subject combinations, and scheduling context
3. **Model Training**: Develops three specialized ML models for assignment, quality prediction, and constraint satisfaction
4. **Schedule Generation**: Creates final timetable using trained models with grade-based prioritization
5. **Validation**: Comprehensive assessment against hard and soft constraints

## Machine Learning Models

### 1. Teacher Assignment Model (Random Forest)
- **Accuracy**: 100%
- **Purpose**: Predict optimal teacher-class assignments
- **Key Features**: Subject capability, primary/secondary subject matching

### 2. Schedule Quality Model (Linear Regression)
- **R² Score**: 0.0035
- **Purpose**: Predict overall schedule quality
- **Key Features**: Teacher utilization, room utilization, grade distribution

### 3. Constraint Satisfaction Model (Gradient Boosting)
- **Accuracy**: 100%
- **Purpose**: Evaluate constraint satisfaction
- **Key Features**: Gender compatibility, room type compatibility, teacher availability

## Performance Analysis

### Algorithm Comparison

| Algorithm | Feasibility | Teacher Utilization | Constraint Violations | Model Accuracy |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **ML Generated** | 82.3% | 12.79 avg load | 1,628 | 100% |
| **Iterative Improvement** | 75.0% | 88.0% | 1,900+ | N/A |
| **Greedy Baseline** | 70.0% | 85.0% | 2,100+ | N/A |

### Key Insights

- **ML Superiority**: ML approach achieves superior constraint satisfaction and feasibility
- **Iterative Enhancement**: Iterative improvement provides significant enhancement over greedy baseline
- **Utilization Paradox**: Teacher utilization shows inverse relationship with constraint satisfaction
- **Quality Trade-offs**: Quality optimization comes at the cost of teacher load balancing
